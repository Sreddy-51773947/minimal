An Aircraft Condition Monitoring system is a predictive maintenance tool consisting of 
high capacity flight data acquisition unit and the associated sensors that sample, 
monitor and record the information of flight parameters from significant aircraft 
system and components.

It is the process by which one or more parameters of a machine are either 
periodically measured or continuously monitored to identify significant changes that 
usually are indicative of a failure in progress. This allows the operator to plan 
maintenance action focused on avoiding failures.

C919 Commercial Airplane for this Crane will assist in the Integration of the Brake 
Control System which include Smartstem passive, Wireless tire pressure sensing 
technology and Brake Temperature Monitoring System.

Brake Controllers receive inputs from sensors which monitor parameters such as 
position,speed,torque,lockup and slip status.

The Brake Control and Monitoring System(BCMS) contain all the necessary Brake 
Control,Autobrake,Antiskid,Tire Pressure Indication, Brake Temperature Monitoring 
and Built-In Test(BIT) functionality for the Main Landing Gear(MLG) wheels and Nose 
Landing Gear(NLG) wheels.
